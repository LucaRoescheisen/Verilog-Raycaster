# TODO

1. Use the camera view plane to find the ray direction
    Make a LUT to find i/360 where i starts at 0 (corresponds to -320)
2. Find ray distance, and calculate height of wall.
3. Remove player_angle input, and create a new module which finds the view direction instead
4. Create a new module that checks the height and creates a frambuffer of the pixel colours.

have two mem height buffers.
When the count gets to 639, switch the usuable height buffer



## OUTPUT HEIGHT OUT OF THE HEIGHT CALCULATOR!!!!
## TELL CALCULATOR WHEN TO START AND WHEN TO STOP!!!!!



1. Add textures, upload a mem file for XOR pattern
2. Find either y or x pos depending on side hit
